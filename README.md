  With simulation and analysis on the project of our senior project, it is not conclusive whether to add an power amplifier to the circuit as did in the their project. 
  My hypothesis is that, rather then adding a power amplifer to the desin we create a coupling line to inject the signal to the 12v power line that feed to the led. 
  However, a main concern is the heat percepitation on the component such as the potentiometer.

  After simulation, the amplifier was caping the singal line missing sharp peaks at the output line.
  If we lower the input signal, the distorsion also fade away.
